<h2>What we do</h2>
<p>We make cheese. Lots of cheese; more than eight tons of cheese a year.</p>

<h2>We make it all</h2>
<h2>Why we do it</h2>
<blockquote>We are paid an awful lot of money by people who like cheese. So we make more. Cheese
is not just for mice anymore, you know. These days everybody is getting into cheese.
(Italics) On sandwiches, salads, with meat, or alone. Itâ€™s the perfect complement to an
appetite. So remember.</blockquote>
