<!-- START OF USING COLOURS -->

<h2><u>How to use colours</u></h2>

<p>In HTML, a colour can be specified by using a colour name. HTML supports 140 standard colour names.</p>

<p>Link to <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/w/w3c-color-names.htm">full list of Colour Names</a> supported by all modern browsers.</p>

<p>In addition to the predefined colour names, colours can be specified in other ways, one of which is HEX (hexadecimal). 
Hex colour codes start with a hashtag (#) and are followed by six letters and/or numbers.

<!-- Note here that I have used the span tag in order to have specific words (red, green and blue) in particular colours and bold -->
 
The first two letters/numbers refer to the colour <span style="font-weight:bold; color: red">red</span>,
the next two to <span style="font-weight:bold; color: green">green</span>,
and the last two to <span style="font-weight:bold; color: blue">blue</span>.
 
The color values are defined in values between 00 and FF. 000000 is black, the absence of colour and ffffff is white.
It doesn't matter if the letters are typed in upper or lowercase.
This gives you access to more than 16 million colours.</p>

<p>Note that we use the American COLOR rather than COLOUR when defining these.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>


<p style="background-color:Tomato;">Tomato background colour on a paragraph.</p>

<h1 style="color:Orange;">Heading 1 in Orange or you could use the HEX code #FFA500</h1>

<h2 style="color:Gray;">Heading 2 in Gray or HEX code #808080 (Note Gray OR Grey works)</h2>

<!-- START OF INSERTING IMAGES -->

<h2><u>How to insert an image into your webpage</u></h2>

<p>This needs more explanation. It is important that the path to the image is correct.</p>

<p>Also, it is good practice to include the <u>height</u> and <u>width</u> so as the space required for the image is reserved when the page is loaded. Without these attributes, the browser does not know the size of the image, and cannot reserve the appropriate space for it.</p>

<p>The <u>alt</u> attribute specifies an alternate text for an image if the image cannot be displayed or if the user uses a screen reader. In this case 'Shanganagh House' will display if, for whatever reason, the image doesn't load. Don't put something like 'image' or 'photo' in the alt but instead, describe the image.</p>


<img src="Shanganagh_House_Shankill.jpg" alt="Shanganagh House"  width="400" height="282">

<!-- START OF INSERTING VIDEOS -->

<h2><u>How to insert a video into your webpage</u></h2>

<p>As with the image, you should include the <u>height</u> and <u>width</u> of the video. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads. 
Any text between the opening and closing video tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the video element.</p>

<p>If you'd prefer the video to start playing automatically, replace 'controls' with 'autoplay' or 'autoplay muted' for it to start playing without sound.</p>

<video width="426" height="240" controls>
  <source src="shanganagh.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<h2><u>How to insert comments in your code</u></h2>

<!-- This is a comment -->
<p>In HTML, a comment is a section of text that is not processed by the web browser. Comments are enclosed in <! -- --> tags (as pictured below) and are a very useful way of organising your coding.</p>
<!-- Comments are not displayed in the browser -->

<img src="comments.jpg" alt="Comments in HTML"  width="524" height="128">
