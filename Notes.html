<h3>You will need to have the code of <a href="https://barbon63.github.io/pizza-stop-exercise2.html" target="_blank">Exercise 2 - Pizza Stop</a> open on the screen while reading these notes in order to make sense of them</h3>
<h4>The code can be viewed by right clicking on the page and choosing <i>View Page Source</i></h4>
<ul>
  <li>I included  a DOCTYPE - They haven't been mentioned yet</li>
  <li>I added lang="en" to the html tag - That hasn't been mentioned yet</li>
  <li>I put the style in the head, rather than in the body as per Bernardine's instructions. This is my preference.</li>
  <li>I have used CSS to make all the required changes in order to keep the HTML clean and uncluttered</li>
  <li>I have included comments in the CSS explaining what each does</li>
  <li>In this exercise, there is only <b>ONE</b> occurance of H1, H2, H3, UL and HR</li>
  <li>I mention this because it has an impact on how I have written my CSS</li>
  <li>The way the CSS is written for these tags means that <b>EVERY</b> occurance of these will be styled in that fashion</li>
  <li>This might not be desirable and may have to be changed as the exercise continues</li>
  <li>There are, however, <b>TWO</b> occurances of DIVs</li>
  <li>This also had an impact on how I wrote my CSS</li>
  <li>For these I made classes as I didn't want them styled in the same way</li>
  <li>One I named 'friday' and the other I named 'center'</li>
  <li>In the html, I applied the relevant class to the relevant div</li>
  <li>You may wonder why I put the pizza image in a div</li>
  <li>It was neccesary to hold the image in the centre of the page <b>AND</b> ensure that <b>ONLY</b> the image was clickable when linked</li>
  <li>Without doing this, the entire width of the page, either side of the image would be clickable</li>
</ul>
