      <p>This is not your run of the mill day-care. 
There is lots of running cross country for the dogs that fancy it (mine doesn't)
 so for the wussy dogs that prefer minimum exertion (that's mine) 
and lots of cuddles (mine again) that's what they get in abundance. 
Having tried quite a few day-care operations, Woof Doggie Day Care really is a home from home, it's the best!</p>

      <p>If I could give more stars I would! 
My girl Moe adores going up to Woof Doggie Daycare 
and she comes back exhausted and delighted every time. 
Linda and Russel are genuinely amazing people, 
incredibly warm and friendly. They love dogs and you 
can see it a mile off. I couldn't recommend more!</p>

      <p>Woof Doggie Daycare is the absolute best for our dog Barkley. 
He loves going there and jumps out of the car and runs in tail wagging 
every morning he’s there!!! Linda and Russell are great and treat the dogs like their own. 
Highly recommended.</p>

      <p>I couldn't recommend Woof Doggie Day Care highly enough. 
Linda and Russell have looked after Bruno on numerous occasions. 
He loves all the walks and activities. 
We are happy knowing that he is being well looked after 
and we would often get a couple of photos of him enjoying himself.</p>
